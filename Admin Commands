All admins activities cannot be performed by a normal users. You need to be a root user to perform the tasks.
Root logins are not allowed in companies and we alternatively use sudo to gain access and perform activities.

All the commands we are going to perform we will add sudo to starting of the command.

$ sudo <command>
  The above command will be executed as a root user and also it will be logged in the system.
  
1. User management
   In RedHat Linux, to add a user it is mandatory to have a group.
   
   Groups:
     -> To add a group , Use the following
        $ sudo groupadd demo
        
     -> To check whether the group is added or not , we can use the following command.
        $ cat /etc/group | grep demo
        
        Del Group: groupdel
        Modify Group: groupmod
       
   Users:
     -> TO create a user, use the following.
        $ sudo useradd -g demo Vkannuri
        
     -> To check whether the user is added or not 
        $ id Vkannuri
        $ cat /etc/passwd | grep Vkannuri
        
     -> Add user to other groups. 
        $ sudo usermod -a -G adm Vkannuri
        
     -> To set a password to Vkannuri user
        $ sudo passwd Vkannuri
        
     -> To swtich from one user to another user then use "su"
        $ su -  Vkannuri

  Sudoers:
     -> To add Vkannuri user to execute commands as root user 
        $ sudo visudo
        
2. Package management
     -> Redhat used RPM (RPM Package manager formerly called as Redhat Package Manager), it is like .exe 
        $ sudo yum list installed
        $ sudo yum list available
        $ sudo yum list (or) $ sudo yum list all
        $ sudo yum install zip -y
        $ sudo yum remove zip -y
        $ sudo yum update zip -y
        
3. Service management.
     -> To manage the services we have "systemctl" in centos7 OS, where as we use to have "service" command earlier on centos 6.
     -> To list all services which are active.
        $ sudo systemctl list-units -t service 
     -> To list all services which includes inactive.
        $ sudo systemctl list-units -t service --all
        
     -> TO start/stop/restart a service.
        $ sudo systemctl start httpd
        $ sudo systemctl stop httpd
        $ sudo systemctl restart httpd
        
     -> To check the status of httpd.
        $ sudo systemctl status httpd
        
     -> To start the service at the time of reboot automatically then 
        $ sudo systemctl enable httpd
        $ sudo systemctl disable httpd

        
4. Network management
    -> Info about IP address.
      $ ip a
      
    -> Server name information.
      $ hostname
      $ hostname -f 
      
    -> Port Info
      Every IP is going to have ports from 0-65535 
      $ sudo netstat -lntp 
      
5. Disk management (Just intro)
    -> To check the disks on the server
      $ sudo fdisk -l
      
    -> To check the mounted file systems
      $ mount
      $ df -h
     In order to access the disk we need to mount it.
     
6. File permissions
  -> Ownerships
    Owner:
       $ sudo chown username filename
    Group Owner:
       $ sudo chgrp username filename
       
       $ sudo chown username:groupname file
       $ sudo chown username:groupname directory -R
    
  -> Permissions
     $ chmod u+x file 
     $ chmod o-r file

Admin topics:

All admins activities cannot be performed by a normal users. You need to be a root user to perform the tasks.
Root logins are not allowed in companies and we alternatively use sudo to gain access and perform activities.

All the commands we are going to perform we will add sudo to starting of the command.

$ sudo <command>
  The above command will be executed as a root user and also it will be logged in the system.
  
1. User management
   In RedHat Linux, to add a user it is mandatory to have a group.
   
   Groups:
     -> To add a group , Use the following
        $ sudo groupadd demo
        
     -> To check whether the group is added or not , we can use the following command.
        $ cat /etc/group | grep demo
        
        Del Group: groupdel
        Modify Group: groupmod
       
   Users:
     -> TO create a user, use the following.
        $ sudo useradd -g demo raju
        
     -> To check whether the user is added or not 
        $ id raju
        $ cat /etc/passwd | grep raju
        
     -> Add user to other groups. 
        $ sudo usermod -a -G adm raju
        
     -> To set a password to raju user
        $ sudo passwd raju
        
     -> To swtich from one user to another user then use "su"
        $ su -  raju
